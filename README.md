# Francesco's Coding Challenge (Leonardo.ai)

This is my submission for the Leonardo.ai coding challenge

[You can view the deployed version here](https://leonardo-challenge-wine.vercel.app)

## Next steps

If I was to continue working on this I would add the following:

-   Some sort of cohesive design system
-   Incorporated more elements from Chakra UI, e.g. Box, Grid, etc.
-   Better error handling, e.g. if the GraphQL query errors the page will just render an error
-   Store the user data in a DB instead of a cookie
-   Working tests (I've added a description of what I would test as a backup)
-   Optimise images, e.g. prefetch when hovering on a tile
-   Make the site look better on a mobile phone

## Bonus: Suggestions for improving the Leonardo.ai image canvas

In addition to the coding challenge I spent some time redesigning the Leonardo.ai image canvas. The goal was to retain the breadth of options found in the UI whilst making it more beginner friendly and perhaps less error prone. I ran out of time and wasn't able to incorporate everything but I think I got the bulk of it. Keen for feedback.
